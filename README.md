<h3 align="center"> This is a simple implementation of a Blockchain and a wallet client in Python 3.</h3>

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
The following dependencies are required to run the project:
- PySimpleGUI
- Flask
- qrcode
- pillow

You can install them easily via `pip` using the following command:
```bash
pip install PySimpleGUI Flask qrcode pillow
```

### Installation
To get started, clone the repository by running the following command in your desired directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vreaw/SuperCoin.git
```

After cloning the repository, navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd SuperCoin
```

### Starting the Blockchain
To start the blockchain, run the following command:
```bash
python3 blockchain.py
```
You will then be prompted to choose a port number for your node to operate on.

Once you have selected a port, everything will be set in motion, and you can proceed to launch the wallet client.
